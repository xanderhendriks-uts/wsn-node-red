The idea is to use the [GitHub flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) model i.e. have master as deployable and merge changes in from feature branches via pull requests.

Any git commits that reference the issue should [mention it](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) in the commit message. Once the issue has been addressed (as far as the developer is concerned), it should be closed with the "fixes #xx" commit message.
